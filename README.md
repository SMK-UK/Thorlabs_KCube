## Thorlabs Kinesis Controller

*Can be used to control any Thorlabs kinesis driver but may require some modification*

Based on the class created by [rbrensesh](https://github.com/rbrenesh/PyKinesis/blob/main/PyKinesis.py)

For more information check the docs [here](https://pylablib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices/Thorlabs_kinesis.html#stages-thorlabs-kinesis)

### Installing the drivers

- Download the drivers [here](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=Motion_Control)

*Once installed make sure to note the driver location on your hard disk!*

This needs to be input on the main script so that python can access the correct dll files

**Please connect to the device using the Thorlabs Kinesis Software first before using this script**
